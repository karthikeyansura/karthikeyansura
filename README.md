# Hey, I'm Karthikeyan 👋

I like understanding why systems break before they break users. I focus on building software that is designed to scale, engineered for reliability, and built to be observable.

- I enjoy working on extensible, high-throughput systems and exploring how to maintain system invariants and data integrity when distributed components are under high contention.
- Lately, I've been diving into the mechanics of storage systems and the challenges of maintaining consistency in large-scale execution.
