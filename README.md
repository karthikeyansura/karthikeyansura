# Hey, I'm Karthikeyan 👋

I like understanding why systems break before they break users. I'm focused on building software that is designed to scale, engineered for reliability, and built to be observable.

I enjoy developing extensible, high-throughput systems and exploring how to maintain system invariants and data integrity when distributed components are under high contention. Currently diving into the mechanics of storage systems and the challenges of maintaining consistency in large-scale execution.
